🥇 Best Option — StackBlitz

Go to stackblitz.com
Click "Start a new project" → choose React + TypeScript + Vite
Delete the default files inside src/
Upload / paste your files into the editor matching the folder structure
It auto-installs and runs live in the browser — share the URL with anyone!


🥈 Option 2 — CodeSandbox

Go to codesandbox.io
Click "Create Sandbox" → "Import from GitHub" (if you push to GitHub) OR choose Vite + React + TS template
Paste your files in
It runs instantly with a shareable live URL


🥉 Option 3 — GitHub + Vercel (Best for sharing permanently)

Push all your files to a GitHub repo
Go to vercel.com → "Add New Project" → import the repo
Vercel auto-detects Vite, builds, and gives you a live public URL like servo-sight.vercel.app



https://stackblitz.com/fork/vitejs-vite-react-ts
Then paste your ServoSight.tsx into src/, update App.tsx to import it, and you're live in seconds.
